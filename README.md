This is a small project that I did for my school. It was in my 9th grade book and it was quite challenging to encode it into cipher text using only a pencil and paper.
Therefore, I came up with the idea of creating a website. I have created a website which you can visit at https://maazmedia.github.io/Cesar-Cipher-Encryption.
